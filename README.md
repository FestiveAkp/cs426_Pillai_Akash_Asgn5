**Game Description and how it relates to the theme:**

A human has a lot of work to get done on their computer, but their cat has other plans.
This is a two player game in which the server plays as the human and the client plays as a cat.
When playing as the human, you have some work to do at your computer, but your pet cat will try their best not to let you.
As the cat, you must step on different plates that are placed around the house in order to stop the human from getting their work done.
This relates to the theme because one of the players is a cat, and the other player has to work on a computer.
