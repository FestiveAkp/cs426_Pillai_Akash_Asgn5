**Game Description and how it relates to the theme:**

A human has a lot of work to get done on their computer, but their cat has other plans.
This is a two player game in which the server plays as the human and the client plays as a cat.
When playing as the human, you have some work to do at your computer, but your pet cat will try their best not to let you.
As the cat, you must step on different plates that are placed around the house in order to stop the human from getting their work done.
This relates to the theme because one of the players is a cat, and the other player has to work on a computer.

**Physics Constructs**
- The player can left-click to throw little balls that bounce off of the walls and floor, which helps establish a facet of the relationship between the player and the cat.
- The stovetop inside the kitchen has a particle system mimicing fire, signaling that the player was cooking something in the kitchen before the game began.

**Billboard**
- There's a cactus on the living room table which is a quad that always faces the player, which adds a personal touch to the design of the living room.

**Lights**
- There are two lights, one of which is colored purple, in the living room, which help illuminate and add personality to the room.
